                  He is the main protagonist. The universe of Dema itself was
                  created in Tyler's head, meaning all aspects of it are
                  metaphors for something he is experiencing.

                  his chest, said to protect his heart. He provides Tyler
                  comfort and is theorised to be the only thing Tyler can
                  remember outside the walls of Dema.

                  Clancy is a character that has been used for storytelling on
                  the dmaorg website using their letters. Clancy's gender or
                  appearance has not been confirmed by the band itself. Their
                  name is an Irish name meaning "Son of the red/ruddy warrior"

                <hr />
                <p>
                  The city of Dema is run by 9 Bishops, each representing one of
                  Tyler's insecurities. They are the ones holding Dema's
                  citizens captive and enforcing the religion known as "Vialism"
                  within the city.

                <h3>Burryface</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>
                  Blurryface is Tyler's alter-ego. A character who makes him
                  hurt other people, brings depression, anxieties and makes him
                  not enjoy life. Through this personification he can better
                  understand his dark side and how to deal with it.

                <p>
                  Making his first appearance in the music video "Chlorine" Ned
                  represents Tyler's perception of creativity and having to take
                  care of it, feed it, satisfy it. It's neither good nor bad.
